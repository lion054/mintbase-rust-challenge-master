## What you should do

1. For this repo and clone it somewhere
2. Run `cargo test`
3. Change the code
4. Repeat until the exit code is zero
5. We'll review it together during your interview.

## Notes

- Tasks are numbered by difficulty
- Test code must not be modified!
- There are no additional dependencies required, so we expect at least a good
  reason should you opt to pull in one.
- The 30 seconds for task 3 are not a hard requirement, but a guideline.
  Specifically, internet speeds might cause this test to fail, so once you think
  you got a sufficient speedup (about 10x from the current implementation), you
  should be good to submit.
